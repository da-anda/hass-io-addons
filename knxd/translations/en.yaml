  address:
    name: Bus Address for KNXD
    description: The KNX address for the knxd deamon itself. Used e.g. for requests originating at the group cache.
  client_address:
    name: Bus Address Pool for KNXD Clients
    description: >
      Address range to be distributed to client connections. Note that the length parameter indicates the number of addresses to be allocated.
      Example: 1.2.3:5 (This assigns addresses 1.2.3 through 1.2.7 to knxd's clients.)
  interface:
    name: Interface Driver
    description: >
      The driver knxd should use as interface to talk to the KNX bus. The most common ones for the typical usecase of this add-on are:
      tpuart (for UART based KNX interfaces, like the one from Busware.de)
      usb (for commercial USB KNX interfaces)
  device:
    name: Device to use for connection
    description: >
      The physical device address of your adapter in linux.
      You can try leaving this blank in order for knxd to auto-detect your device.
  usb_filters:
    name: usb_filters
    description: When using an USB interface, you can specify additional filters to use. See the filters[https://github.com/knxd/knxd/blob/master/doc/inifile.rst#filters] section of the official knxd documentation.
  custom_config:
    name: Complete custom config
    description: >
      Allows you to write your own, custom knxd ini configuration instead of using the prepared template from this add-on that makes use of all the other config options above.
      Your custom configuration will replace the default configuration provided by this add-on and thus all the other config options above will be ignored. See the knxd documentation for all possible configuration options.

    name: KNXD Loglevel
    description: Define the loglevel of knxd.
